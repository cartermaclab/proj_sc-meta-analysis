Wulf \& Toole (1999) & "If the beneficial effects of self-control found in previous studies are more general in nature (i.e., some general mechanism responsible for these effects), learning advantage would also be expected for self-controlled use of physical assistance." & Two cell & Difference in means & "The main effect of Group, F(1,24) = 4.54, p < .05, was significant.

Wulf, Clauss, Shea \& Whitacre (2001) & "Importantly, however, if self-control promotes the development of a more efficient movement technique, one should see greater movement efficiency, as indicated by delayed force onsets, in self-control as compared to yoked participants." & Two cell & Difference in means & "Whereas the self-control group demonstrated relative force onsets that, on average, occurred about half the distance between the center of the apparatus and the participant's maximum amplitude, the yoked group’s average force onset had already occurred after they had travelled less than 20\% of the distance to the maximum amplitude.

Wulf, Raupach \& Pfeiffer (2005) & "Thus, if the learning advantages of self-controlled practice generalize to observational practice, allowing learners to decide when they want to view a model presentation should result in enhanced retention performance, with regard to movement form and, perhaps, movement accuracy, compared to that of yoked learners." & Two cell & Difference in means & "Overall, the self-control group had higher form scores than the yoked group throughout retention.

Wulf, Iwatsuki, Machin, Kellogg, Copeland, \& Lewthwaite (2017) Exp 1. & "The purpose of the present experiments was threefold. First, we deemed it important to provide further evidence for the impact of incidental choices on motor skill learning. Given that self-controlled practice benefits for learning have frequently been interpreted from an information-processing perspective (e.g., Carter, Carlson, \& Ste-Marie, 2014; Carter \& Ste-Marie, 2016), with limited regard for rewarding-motivational explanations, further experimental evidence for learning enhancements through choices not directly related to the task seemed desirable (Experiments 1 and 2)." & Two cell & Difference in means & "On the retention test one day later, the choice group demonstrated higher scores than did the control group. The group effect was significant, F(1, 29) = 5.72, p < .05." & F(1, 29) = 5.72\\

Wulf, Chiviacowsky \& Drews (2015) & "To summarize, we hypothesized that an external focus and autonomy support would have additive benefits for motor learning (i.e., retention and transfer performance), as evidenced by main effects for each factor." & 2 (Autonomy support: self, yoked) X 2 (Focus: external, internal) & Difference in means & "On the retention test, the main effect of Autonomy Support was significant, F(1, 64) = 6.98, p < .01." & F(1,64) = 6.98\\

Ikudome, Kuo, Ogasa, Mori \& Nakamoto (2019; Exp. 2) & "Previous studies manipulating participants’ choice of variables relevant to the experimental task have indicated that such choices have a positive effect on motor learning due to deeper information processing by the participants. Based on these studies, it is possible that this positive effect would be observed regardless of participants’ levels of intrinsic motivation, because this type of choice would not induce a change in perceived locus of causality from internal to external." & 2(Choice: self, yoked) X 2 (Motivation: high, low) & Difference in means & "An ANCOVA indicated significant main effects of choice, F(1, 39) = 8.93, p = .005." & F(1,39) = 8.93\\
