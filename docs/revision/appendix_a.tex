Wulf \& Toole (1999) & "If the beneficial effects of self-control found in previous studies are more general in nature (i.e., some general mechanism responsible for these effects), learning advantage would also be expected for self-controlled use of physical assistance." & Two cell & Difference in means & "The main effect of Group, F(1,24) = 4.54, p < .05, was significant.

Wulf, Clauss, Shea \& Whitacre (2001) & "Importantly, however, if self-control promotes the development of a more efficient movement technique, one should see greater movement efficiency, as indicated by delayed force onsets, in self-control as compared to yoked participants." & Two cell & Difference in means & "Whereas the self-control group demonstrated relative force onsets that, on average, occurred about half the distance between the center of the apparatus and the participant's maximum amplitude, the yoked groupâ€™s average force onset had already occurred after they had travelled less than 20\% of the distance to the maximum amplitude.

Wulf, Raupach \& Pfeiffer (2005) & "Thus, if the learning advantages of self-controlled practice generalize to observational practice, allowing learners to decide when they want to view a model presentation should result in enhanced retention performance, with regard to movement form and, perhaps, movement accuracy, compared to that of yoked learners." & Two cell & Difference in means & "Overall, the self-control group had higher form scores than the yoked group throughout retention.

Wulf, Iwatsuki, Machin, Kellogg, Copeland, \& Lewthwaite (2017) Exp 1. & "The purpose of the present experiments was threefold. First, we deemed it important to provide further evidence for the impact of incidental choices on motor skill learning. Given that self-controlled practice benefits for learning have frequently been interpreted from an information-processing perspective (e.g., Carter, Carlson, \& Ste-Marie, 2014; Carter \& Ste-Marie, 2016), with limited regard for rewarding-motivational explanations, further experimental evidence for learning enhancements through choices not directly related to the task seemed desirable (Experiments 1 and 2)." & Two cell & Difference in means & "On the retention test one day later, the choice group demonstrated higher scores than did the control group. The group effect was significant, F(1, 29) = 5.72, p < .05." & F(1, 29) = 5.72\\

Wulf, Chiviacowsky \& Drews (2015) & "To summarize, we hypothesized that an external focus and autonomy support would have additive benefits for motor learning (i.e., retention and transfer performance), as evidenced by main effects for each factor." & 2 (Autonomy support: self, yoked) X 2 (Focus: external, internal) & Difference in means & "On the retention test, the main effect of Autonomy Support was significant, F(1, 64) = 6.98, p < .01." & F(1,64) = 6.98\\

Ikudome, Kuo, Ogasa, Mori \& Nakamoto (2019; Exp. 2) & "Previous studies manipulating participantsâ€™ choice of variables relevant to the experimental task have indicated that such choices have a positive effect on motor learning due to deeper information processing by the participants. Based on these studies, it is possible that this positive effect would be observed regardless of participantsâ€™ levels of intrinsic motivation, because this type of choice would not induce a change in perceived locus of causality from internal to external." & 2(Choice: self, yoked) X 2 (Motivation: high, low) & Difference in means & "An ANCOVA indicated significant main effects of choice, F(1, 39) = 8.93, p = .005." & F(1,39) = 8.93\\
