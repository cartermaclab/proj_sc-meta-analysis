  title     = "The recommendation for learners to be provided with control over
               their feedback schedule is questioned in a self-controlled
               learning paradigm",
  author    = "Yantha, Zachary",
  abstract  = "Researchers have shown that learners who self-control (SC) their
               knowledge of results (KR) schedule learn the task more
               effectively than yoked learners. A common recommendation from
               these results is that learners should be provided choice over
               their KR schedule, rather than at a coaches' discretion (Wulf \&
               Lewthwaite, 2016). No research to date has compared SC learners
               to a group that more closely mimics receiving KR from a coach,
               thus challenging whether such a recommendation can be made. To
               this end, three groups learned a golf putting task; an SC group,
               a traditional yoked group (TY), and a group who were led to
               believe that their KR schedule was being controlled by a golf
               coach (perceived coach-controlled yoked group; PCC).
               Participants (N = 60) completed three phases; pre-test,
               acquisition, and two 24-hr delayed post-tests
               (retention/transfer). All groups lowered their mean radial error
               (MRE) and bivariate variable error (BVE) throughout acquisition.
               As hypothesized, the SC group (M = 40.10) had lower adjusted MRE
               compared to the TY group (M = 43.12) during the post-tests, yet,
               the PCC group had the lowest adjusted MRE (M = 36.61). These
               differences, however, were not statistically significant, F(2,
               54) = 2.81, p = .069. BVE did not display the same pattern as
               MRE during the post-test as group means were clustered together,
               F(2, 57) = 0.38, p = .963. Results from a questionnaire
               indicated that both yoked groups showed moderate ratings for
               receiving KR on a desired schedule, as well as preferring KR on
               good trials, or good and bad trials equally. Taken together,
               these results call into question the recommendation for
               practitioners to give choice to a learner over KR scheduling.",

  title     = "Motor skill learning and performance: a review of influential
               factors",
  author    = "Wulf, Gabriele and Shea, Charles and Lewthwaite, Rebecca",
  abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: Findings from the contemporary psychological and
               movement science literature that appear to have implications for
               medical training are reviewed. Specifically, the review focuses
               on four factors that have been shown to enhance the learning of
               motor skills: observational practice; the learner's focus of
               attention; feedback, and self-controlled practice. OBSERVATIONAL
               PRACTICE: Observation of others, particularly when it is
               combined with physical practice, can make important
               contributions to learning. This includes dyad practice (i.e.
               practice in pairs), which is not only cost-effective, but can
               also enhance learning. FOCUS OF ATTENTION: Studies examining the
               role of the performer's focus of attention have consistently
               demonstrated that instructions inducing an external focus
               (directed at the movement effect) are more effective than those
               promoting an internal focus (directed at the performer's body
               movements). An external focus facilitates automaticity in motor
               control and promotes movement efficiency. FEEDBACK: Feedback not
               only has an informational function, but also has motivational
               properties that have an important influence on learning. For
               example, feedback after successful trials and social-comparative
               (normative) feedback indicating better than average performance
               have been shown to have a beneficial effect on learning.
               SELF-CONTROLLED PRACTICE: Self-controlled practice, including
               feedback and model demonstrations controlled by the learner, has
               been found to be more effective than externally controlled
               practice conditions. CONCLUSIONS: All factors reviewed in this
               article appear to have both informational and motivational
               influences on learning. The findings seem to reflect general
               learning principles and are assumed to have relatively broad
               applicability. Therefore, the consideration of these factors in
               designing procedures for medical training has the potential to
               enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of training.",

               yoked group received haptic assistance on blocks determined by a

               rationales for/experiences of the haptic assistance that was
               chosen/provided, themes emerged regarding participants' views of
               the utility of haptic assistance for performance and learning.
               Results showed that learning was directly impacted by the
               frequency of haptic assistance for self-controlled participants

  abstract  = "A growing body of recent research has pointed to the potential
               value of allowing learners to have some autonomy in shaping
               their learning environment. Studies of this so-called
               self-control effect have demonstrated that allowing learners to
               control some aspect of the instructional setting facilitates
               motor learning compared to conditions that are controlled
               externally. The purpose of the present study is to examine how
               learners ostensibly provided self-control over feedback behave
               when the actual availability of feedback is constrained by a
               predetermined schedule of coach availability to provide
               feedback. Furthermore, an investigation into potential
               underlying mechanisms will be examined through a
               self-determination theory (SDT) lens. Participants were assigned
               to one of four feedback groups -- 100\% feedback group (KR100),
               50\% feedback group (KR50), self-controlled feedback group (SC),
               and yoked group (YK) -- in order to learn a key-pressing task.
               Post training measures of basic need satisfaction were obtained
               through a modified version of the Basic Psychological Needs
               Satisfaction Survey (BPNS). The acquisition phase consisted of
               72 practice trials of the key-pressing task. Approximately 24
               hours after acquisition, each participant returned to complete
               tests of retention and transfer. Results revealed a
               significantly lower absolute constant error (ACE) score for the
               SC group during transfer (p < .05). There were also no
               significant differences between group BPNS sub-category scores.
               The results of this study suggest evidence for the robustness of
               the SC effect in a reduced feedback availability environment as
               well as evidence supporting underlying mechanisms other than
               motivation as driving the effect. Secondly, the results provide
               some evidence for the role of scarcity in elevating the number
               of feedback requests in a reduced autonomy environment.",

               of self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation, as well as perceived
               choice between the LC and EC conditions. Two groups (LC and EC)
               of children (M age of 11.2 years; SD = 1.89) attempted to learn
               a progression of trampoline skills during a 2-day acquisition
               phase in which video self-observation was available. The second
               acquisition day was followed by a no self-observation retention

               the LC group would be more self-efficacious about their ability

  abstract  = "Motor learning research has suggested that self-controlled
               practice (or ``autonomy'') leads to more effective learning of
               motor tasks. Debate continues, however, as to why. Most motor
               behaviorists maintain the better learning is due to cognitive
               and information-processing factors. Recently, others have
               proposed the learning enhancement is due to such psychological
               factors as motivation and affect. The present study sought to
               measure motor skill learning, intrinsic motivation, and affect
               in self-controlled versus externally-controlled (yoked) practice
               conditions. Participants, 16 collegiate women's volleyball
               student-athletes from two National Collegiate Athletic
               Association Division I programs, were paired by forearm passing
               skill level, and one of each pair was randomly placed in either
               the self-control or yoked group. The self-control participants
               were asked to design their own forearm passing drill during the
               practice phase of the experiment. The yoked participants
               followed the design established by the self-control participant
               to whom they were yoked. Each of the participants' forearm
               passing accuracy was measured in a free ball passing drill
               consisting of a pre-test and practice phase on Day 1, and a
               post-test on Day 2. Their intrinsic motivation was measured
               using the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI), and their
               positive and negative affect was measured using the Positive and
               Negative Affect Scale  Expanded Edition (PANAS-X). The IMI and
               PANAS-X were administered in a baseline condition (after a team
               practice one week prior to participation in the study) at the
               end of Day 1, and the end of Day 2. Analysis of the data
               revealed no statistically significant differences between groups
               in either forearm passing, intrinsic motivation, or affect.
               Further research is needed to determine if intrinsic motivation
               and affect are partially responsible for the learning benefits
               of self-controlled practice.",

               expectancy-related predictions. Specifically, we examined the
               effects of practice with autonomy support on learners'
               self-efficacy, positive affect, and thoughts during practice.
               Design Experimental study with two groups. Movement form was
               assessed in two different experimental phases, supplemented by
               questionnaire data. Method Ten-year old children were shown a
               sequence of 5 ballet positions they were asked to learn:
               Preparatory position, demi pli{\'e}, tendu with arms and legs in
               second position, pass{\'e} with arms in first position, and
               elev{\'e} with feet in first position. In the autonomy-support
               (AS) group, participants were able to choose video
               demonstrations throughout practice, while control (C) group
               participants were provided with demonstrations based on their
               yoked counterparts' choices. One day after practice,

               motivation, engagement, and learning in a video game task.
               Previous studies have shown increased autonomy during practice
               leads to superior retention of motor skills, but it is not clear
               why this benefit occurs. Some studies suggest this benefit
               arises from increased motivation during practice; others suggest
               the benefit arises from better information processing. Sixty
               novice participants were randomly assigned to a self-controlled
               group, who chose the progression of difficulty during practice,
               or to a yoked group, who experienced the same difficulty
               progression but did not have choice. At the end of practice,
               participants completed surveys measuring intrinsic motivation
               and engagement. One week later, participants returned for a
               series of retention tests at three different difficulty levels.
               RM-ANCOVA (controlling for pre-test) showed that the
               self-controlled group had improved retention compared to the
               yoked group, on average, $\beta$=46.78, 95\% CI=[2.68, 90.87],
               p=0.04, but this difference was only statistically significant
               on the moderate difficulty post-test (p=0.004). The
               self-controlled group also showed greater intrinsic motivation
               during practice, t(58)=2.61, p=0.01. However, there was no
               evidence that individual differences in engagement (p=0.20) or
               motivation (p=0.87) were associated with learning, which was the
               relationship this experiment was powered to detect. These data
               are inconsistent with strictly motivational accounts of how
               autonomy benefits learning, instead suggesting the benefits of
               autonomy may be mediated through other mechanisms. For instance,
               within the information processing framework, the learning
               benefits may emerge from learners appropriately adjusting
               difficulty to maintain an appropriate level of challenge (i.e.,
               maintaining the relationship between task demands and cognitive
               resources).",

               6-key-pressing task with a goal movement time was adopted as the
               experimental task. The behavioral results showed that the SC
               group demonstrated superior performance in transfer; however,
               the differences in retention did not reach statistical
               significance. Event-related potential analyses revealed that the

               The post-response error positivity amplitude was found to be

               in a self-directed learning environment among novice trainees.
               METHODS: Thirty novice trainees used CBVT to learn the 1-handed
               square knot while self-assessing their proficiency every 3
               minutes. On reaching self-assessed skill proficiency, trainees
               were randomized to either cease practice or to complete
               additional practice. Performance was evaluated with computer and
               expert-based measures during practice and on pretests,

               skills. Twenty participants walked through virtual corridors in
               which rhythmically opening and closing sliding doors were
               placed. The participants aimed to adjust their walking speed so
               as to cross the doors when the doors were close to their maximal
               aperture width. The highest level of performance was achieved by
               learners who practiced the task with unambiguous self-controlled
               concurrent feedback, which is to say, by learners who could
               request that feedback at wish. Practice with imposed rather than
               self-controlled feedback and practice without concurrent
               feedback were shown to be less effective. Finally, the way in
               which the self-controlled concurrent feedback was presented was
               also found to be of paramount importance; if the feedback is
               ambiguous, it may even prevent participants from learning the

               rise to higher levels of performance than other feedback
               conditions (compared to imposed schedule) but, depending on the
               way it is presented, the feedback can also prevent the

               their learning environment (e.g., augmented feedback) has been
               shown to be beneficial during skill acquisition. Although
               Chiviacowsky and Wulf (2002, 2005) indicated that learners in a
               self-control protocol preferred feedback after so-called good
               performances rather than bad ones, Aiken, Fairbrother, \& Post
               (2012) found no such preference in learners using video
               knowledge of performance (KP) for a basketball set shot.
               Laughlin (2012) reported that participants given self-control
               over four different types of instructional assistance displayed
               individualized request patterns tied to task proficiency and
               personal preferences. For example, learners' requests for
               knowledge of results (KR) increased throughout acquisition while
               those for KP decreased. Together, Aiken et al. (2012) and
               Laughlin (2012) indicated that learner's decisions about the
               timing and content of requested feedback are more complex than
               previously demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to
               examine feedback request behaviors and self-control effects in a
               protocol allowing learners to manage the provision of KP about
               four different critical features of a fairly complex task
               (ergometer rowing). The use of KP allowed an exploration of how
               learners' feedback requests were tied to their success on each
               movement element and their perceptions of proficiency. The
               inclusion of a yoked control group extended Laughlin's design to
               test whether or not a self-control benefit would be seen in a
               protocol that placed a relatively high information-management
               burden on the participants. Results revealed that the
               Self-Control (SC) group achieved significantly higher mean form
               scores during acquisition and retention, and also significantly
               lower heart rate during retention compared to the yoked (YK)
               group. Additionally, responses to a post-practice interview
               showed that SC participants' requests for KP followed both good
               and bad trials, and were used for both error correction and
               confirmation of success. These findings indicated that
               self-control of KP for multiple critical features benefits
               learning of a complex task. The pattern of KP requests indicated
               that participants generally focused on the easier critical
               features early in practice. Moreover, participants used KP more
               for correction early, but increased its use for success
               confirmation as they gained proficiency.",

  abstract  = "When there is publication bias, studies yielding large p values,

               published, which leads to biased estimates of effects in
               meta-analysis. We investigate a selection model based on
               one-tailed p values in the context of a random effects model.
               The procedure both models the selection process and corrects for
               the consequences of selection on estimates of the mean and
               variance of effect parameters. A test of the statistical
               significance of selection is also provided. The small sample
               properties of the method are evaluated by means of simulations,
               and the asymptotic theory is found to be reasonably accurate
               under correct model specification and plausible conditions. The
               method substantially reduces bias due to selection when model
               specification is correct, but the variance of estimates is
               increased; thus mean squared error is reduced only when
               selection produces substantial bias. The robustness of the
               method to violations of assumptions about the form of the
               distribution of the random effects is also investigated via
               simulation, and the model-corrected estimates of the mean effect
               are generally found to be much less biased than the uncorrected
               estimates. The significance test for selection bias, however, is
               found to be highly nonrobust, rejecting at up to 10 times the
               nominal rate when there is no selection but the distribution of

               typically does not learn the task as well as the self-control
               group. Although the groups are matched for the amount of
               feedback they receive, the information is provided on trials in
               which the individual may not request feedback if he or she were

               effect sizes were found for ego depletion on effort, perceived
               difficulty, negative affect, subjective fatigue, and blood
               glucose levels. Small, nonsignificant effects were found for

               addictions. In contrast, self-control failure is linked to

               regulation and outcomes. A popular approach to understanding
               self-control is the strength or resource depletion model.
               Self-control is conceptualized as a limited resource that
               becomes depleted after a period of exertion resulting in
               self-control failure. The model has typically been tested using
               a sequential-task experimental paradigm, in which people
               completing an initial self-control task have reduced
               self-control capacity and poorer performance on a subsequent
               task, a state known as ego depletion Although a meta-analysis of
               ego-depletion experiments found a medium-sized effect,
               subsequent meta-analyses have questioned the size and existence
               of the effect and identified instances of possible bias. The

               been used up or depleted, they are less available for other
               self-control tasks, leading to a decrement in subsequent
               self-control success. The depletion effect has been studied for
               over 20 years, tested or extended in more than 600 studies, and
               supported in an independent meta-analysis (Hagger et al., 2010).

               explanation is that self-controlled KR schedules lead learners
               to more active task involvement, permitting deeper information
               processing. This study tested this explanatory hypothesis.
               Thirty undergraduate volunteers of both sexes, aged 18 to 35,
               all novices in the task, practiced transporting a tennis ball in
               a specified sequence within a time goal. We compared a
               high-involvement group (involvement yoked, IY), notified in
               advance about upcoming KR trials, to self-controlled KR (SC) and
               yoked KR (YK) groups. The experiment consisted of three phases:
               acquisition, retention, and transfer. We found both IY and SC
               groups to be superior to YK for transfer of learning.
               Postexperiment participant questionnaires confirmed a preference
               for receiving KR after learner-perceived good trials, even
               though performance on those trials did not differ from
               performance on trials without KR. Equivalent IY and SC
               performances provide support for the benefits of task
               involvement and deeper information processing when KR is
               self-controlled in motor skill acquisition.",

               characteristics like their impulsivity can also influence how
               people engage cognitively during learning. We investigated
               possible dissociations between the types of interaction in
               self-controlled knowledge of results (KR) and learner
               impulsivity levels in learning a sequential motor task. Ninety

               Barkley deficits in executive functioning scale, and those 60
               participants with the highest ( n = 30) and lowest ( n = 30)
               impulsivity scores practiced a motor task involving sequential
               pressing of four keys in predetermined absolute and relative
               times. We further divided participants into four experimental
               groups by assigning the high- and low-impulsivity groups to two
               forms of KR-self-controlled absolute and yoked. Study results
               showed no interaction effect between impulsivity and
               self-controlled KR, and, contrary to expectation,
               self-controlled KR did not benefit learning, independently of
               impulsivity. However, low-impulsivity participants performed
               better than high-impulsivity participants on the absolute
               dimension of the transfer task, while high-impulsivity learners
               were better at the relative dimension. Cognitive characteristics

               strategies used to direct attention to relative and absolute
               task dimensions, respectively. Low-impulsivity learners switched
               their attention to both dimensions at the end of practice, while
               high-impulsivity learners did not switch their attention or
               directed it only to the relative dimension at the end of the
               practice. These results suggest that the cognitive styles of
               high- and low-impulsive learners differentially favor learning
               distinct dimensions of a motor task, regardless of

               practiced a coincident-anticipation timing task with a
               self-controlled feedback schedule during practice. Specifically,
               they were able to ask for feedback after 3 trials in each of
               three 10-trial practice blocks. While one group (Self-30) was
               told that an error of 30 ms or less would be considered good
               performance, another group (Self-4) was informed that an error
               of 4 ms or less would be considered a good trial. A third,

               studies investigating the provision of autonomy support to older

               to investigate the effects of providing choice over feedback on
               motor learning in older adults. Participants were divided into
               two groups, choice and no-choice, and practiced 36 trials of a
               linear positioning task. Before each block of six trials,
               participants from the choice group were given the choice to
               control, or not, when to receive feedback in the block.
               No-choice group participants received feedback according to the
               same schedule as their choice group counterparts, but they could
               not choose when to receive it. Two days later, participants of
               both groups performed retention and transfer tests. The choice
               group demonstrated lower absolute error scores during transfer

  abstract  = "Objective In previous self-controlled feedback studies, it was
               observed that participants who could control their own feedback
               schedules usually use a strategy of choosing feedback after
               successful trials, and present superior motor learning when
               compared with participants who were not allowed to choose. Yoked
               participants of these studies, however, were thwarted not only
               regarding autonomy but also, presumably, regarding perceived
               competence, as their feedback schedules were provided randomly,
               regarding good or bad trials. The purpose of the present study
               was to examine whether self-controlled feedback schedules would
               have differential effects on learning if yoked participants are
               provided with feedback after good trials at the same rate as
               their self-controlled counterparts. Design Experimental study
               with two groups. Timing accuracy was assessed in two different
               experimental phases, supplemented by questionnaire data. Method
               Participants practiced a coincident-anticipation timing task
               with a self-controlled or yoked feedback schedule during
               practice. Participants of the self-controlled group were able to
               ask for feedback for two trials, after each of five 6-trial
               practice blocks. Yoked participants received a feedback schedule
               matching the self-control group schedule, according to accuracy.
               Results Participants asked for (self-controlled group) and
               received (yoked group) feedback, mainly after relatively good
               trials. However, participants of the self-controlled group
               reported greater self-efficacy at the end of practice, and
               performed with greater accuracy one day later, on the retention
               test, than the yoked group. Conclusions The findings indicate
               that the autonomy provided by self-controlled feedback protocols
               can raise learners' perceptions of competence, with positive
               consequences on motor learning.",

  abstract  = "Investigations into the strategies that are used by participants
               when they control their knowledge of results (KR) schedule
               during practice have predominantly relied on multiple-choice
               questionnaires. More recently, open-ended questions have been
               used to allow participants to produce their own descriptions
               rather than selecting a strategy from a predetermined list. This
               approach has in fact generated new information about the
               cognitive strategies used by learners to request KR during
               practice (e.g., Laughlin et al., 2015). Consequently, we
               examined strategy use in self-controlled KR learning situations
               using open-ended questions at two different time points during
               practice. An inductive thematic content analysis revealed five

               second half of practice. Both strategies were associated with

               well-documented, the brain regions contributing to these

               highlight regions that could be targeted in more applied
               settings to boost the already beneficial effects of
               self-controlled KR schedules. Here, we investigated whether
               applying anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
               to the primary motor cortex (M1) would enhance the typically
               found benefits of learning a novel motor skill with a
               self-controlled KR schedule. Participants practiced a
               spatiotemporal task in one of four groups using a factorial
               combination of KR schedule (self-controlled vs. yoked) and tDCS
               (anodal vs. sham). Testing occurred on two consecutive days with
               spatial and temporal accuracy measured on both days and learning
               was assessed using 24-h retention and transfer tests without KR.
               All groups improved their performance in practice and a
               significant effect for practicing with a self-controlled KR
               schedule compared to a yoked schedule was found for temporal
               accuracy in transfer, but a similar advantage was not evident in
               retention. There were no significant differences as a function
               of KR schedule or tDCS for spatial accuracy in retention or
               transfer. The lack of a significant tDCS effect suggests that M1
               may not strongly contribute to self-controlled KR learning
               advantages; however, caution is advised with this interpretation

               However, it is not clear which methods work best for data
               typically seen in psychology. Here, we present a comprehensive
               simulation study in which we examined how some of the most

               realistically be produced by research in psychology. We
               simulated several levels of questionable research practices,
               publication bias, and heterogeneity, and used study sample sizes
               empirically derived from the literature. Our results clearly
               indicated that no single meta-analytic method consistently
               outperformed all the others. Therefore, we recommend that
               meta-analysts in psychology focus on sensitivity analyses?that
               is, report on a variety of methods, consider the conditions
               under which these methods fail (as indicated by simulation
               studies such as ours), and then report how conclusions might
               change depending on which conditions are most plausible.
               Moreover, given the dependence of meta-analytic methods on
               untestable assumptions, we strongly recommend that researchers

               psychomotor skills better when they are allowed self-guided
               access to instructional material and when they set goals that
               are related to performance processes rather than performance
               outcomes. The present study assessed whether self-guided access
               to instruction and the setting of process goals lead to better
               acquisition of clinical technical skills. METHODS: To learn
               wound closure skills, 48 medical students were randomly assigned
               to one of four groups in a 2 x 2 study design. Self-guided
               participants were able to access the instructional video freely,
               whereas control participants were restricted to watching only
               those video segments accessed by their matched self-guided
               participant. Each group was further divided into two subgroups,
               comprising a process goal subgroup, where participants set goals
               focused on performance mechanisms, and an outcome goal subgroup,
               where participants set goals focused on performance products.
               Performance on pre-, post-, retention and transfer tests was
               assessed with hand motion measures and expert evaluations. Group
               differences were evaluated using one-way anovas. RESULTS: The
               self-guided group with process goals showed greater skill
               retention than its matched control group, whereas the
               self-guided group with outcome goals did not. Furthermore, the

               the instructional video most frequently. CONCLUSIONS: Our
               findings advance the study of independent learning in medical
               education. Trainees used interactive and structured
               instructional materials to effectively self-guide their learning
               of clinical technical skills. However, a self-guided benefit was

  abstract  = "Research during the past few decades has demonstrated that
               allowing individuals to control some aspect of the instructional
               setting can facilitate motor learning. This facilitation has
               most commonly been referred to as the self-control effect.
               Self-control studies often include a yoked group. This group is
               meant to counterbalance the aspect of choice given to the
               self-control group. However, these groups pose a certain problem
               to the generalization of self-control---the procedure of yoking
               would never be utilized as a learning construct a real-world
               setting. Thus, there is a need to investigate the ecological
               validity of self-control in a more applied setting.
               Specifically, investigating the effect of implementing
               self-control in a setting where observation of other learners is
               inherently available (e.g. groups, teams). Participants were
               assigned based on when they volunteered for the study to one of
               five groups in order to learn a cup-stacking task. Four groups
               were crossing the two levels of the self-control factor,
               self-control (SC) and yoked (YK) with the two levels of
               observation factor, observation (O) and no observation (NO):
               SC-NO, YK-NO, SC-O, and YK-O. For each level of observation, the
               yoked participants were paired with self-control counterparts
               (e.g. SC-NO paired with YK-NO). A fifth group was created by
               pairing a second yoked group to the SC-NO and providing it with
               observation (e.g. YK2-O). Acquisition consisted of 30 practice
               trials. Approximately 24 hours later, participants returned to
               complete retention and transfer testing. Mean movement time (MT)
               scores during retention and transfer revealed that the YK-NO
               group was significantly slower than all other groups (p < .05).
               The results suggested that the application of self-control
               provisions to facilitate learning may be limited in group
               settings that afford the opportunity to observe other learners.",

               (SC) (n = 10) and yoked (YK) (n = 10) groups. SC participants

               (2004) argue that learning is maximized when a person faces an

               challenge level can be manipulated through the combination of
               different practice variables. The purpose of this study was to
               investigate how practice schedule and self-controlled feedback
               frequency manipulations affect performance and learning of motor
               skills. Participants (n=96) attempted to learn three versions of
               a key-pressing task. The task consisted of pressing five
               computer keys in specified sequences in a goal criterion time.
               Participants were assigned to either a blocked practice schedule
               with self-controlled feedback (BLK-SC), a random practice
               schedule with self-controlled feedback (RND-SC), a blocked
               practice schedule with yoked feedback (BLK-YK), a random

               Participants in the blocked conditions practiced 30 trials of
               each task according to a blocked practice schedule. Participants
               in the random conditions practiced 30 trial of each task
               according to a random practice schedule. Participants in the
               self-controlled feedback condition were allowed to choose
               whether or not to receive feedback on each trial. Yoked
               participants had their feedback schedule matched to a
               participant with similar characteristics in the self-control
               condition. Participants in the 100\% feedback condition received
               feedback after every trial. Participants were also asked to
               complete the NASA Task Load Index (Hart \& Staveland, 1988) and
               an adapted Perceived Competence for Learning scale (adapted from
               Williams \& Deci, 1996) after the completion of the 5th and 90th
               trial. After 24 hr participants performed a retention test. The
               results indicated no difference between groups during retention
               or for the NASA-TLX and PCL scores. The feedback frequency
               analysis indicated no differences between BLK-SC and RND-SC
               groups. In general, the findings of the present study show that
               the effects of practice schedule conditions can be offset by
               self-controlled feedback manipulations. They also suggest that a
               number of different combinations of practice schedules and
               feedback frequencies can lead to similar challenge levels.",

               control over some aspect of their practice environment has led
               to numerous potential explanations for its beneficial effects
               (Janelle et al., 1997; Chiviacowsky \& Wulf, 2002). These
               explanations, however, are vague and difficult to directly
               measure. Current research suggests that learners in a
               self-controlled setting prefer feedback after relatively good
               performances. More recently, Aiken and colleagues (2012) have
               provided evidence suggesting that when learners control their
               feedback schedule while learning a task with multiple dimensions
               of performance, they prefer and request feedback after both
               ``good'' and ``poor trials'' equally. The purpose of this study
               was to directly address how learners in self-controlled and
               yoked conditions learn a task with two conflicting elements of
               performance in a laboratory setting. Participants (n=22) learned
               a discrete aiming task for which they had to move from a
               starting zone around a barrier to a target with a handheld
               stylus in their non-dominant hand in 600 ms. Success was
               determined on two criteria: temporal and spatial accuracy.
               Participants completed motivation scales assessing intrinsic
               motivation, perceptions of choice and competence, and
               fulfillment of basic psychological needs. A post-training
               questionnaire was used to examine learner preferences for
               feedback. Results indicated the self-control group outperformed
               the yoked group in spatial accuracy during transfer tests.
               Further, analysis of performance and questionnaire data revealed
               that the self-control group requested feedback equally on their
               best performance as on their worst performances. The findings of
               this study support the notion that learners request and benefit
               from feedback differently dependent on task complexity. Future
               research should consider using semi-structured interviews to

              effects of external focus instructions and autonomy support on
              motor performance of children. In addition, we sought to provide
              evidence for an increased focus on the task goal under the
              external focus condition by using an inattentional blindness
              manipulation. Design Within-participant design. Method Thirty-six
              children (mean age = 8.5 $\pm$ 1.3 years) were asked to perform a
              bowling task with their dominant hand. Each participant performed
              8 trials under external focus (path of the ball), internal focus
              (hand), or control conditions. In each attentional focus
              condition, they performed half of the trials under a choice
              (autonomy support) condition, in which they were able to choose
              among 4 bowling balls, and a no-choice condition (white ball).
              Results The external focus instruction resulted in greater
              bowling accuracy (i.e., more pins knocked down) than internal
              focus and no instructions (control). Furthermore, choice resulted
              in more effective performance than no choice. Thus, both factors
              had additive benefits for performance. There was some evidence
              for an increased task focus in the external condition.
              Conclusions The present results show that, within the same
              individuals, instructions to adopt an external focus and the
              provision of a small choice contributed independently to enhance
              motor performance in children.",

              The present experiment investigated whether self-controlled KR
              learning benefits would be eliminated if an interpolated activity
              was performed during the KR-delay interval. Participants
              practiced a waveform matching task that required two rapid elbow

              factorial combination of choice (self-controlled, yoked) and

              specific spatial and temporal constraints, and an overall

              transfer of the Self-After group likely emerged from information
              processing activities such as error estimation. However, the lack
              of yoked groups and a measure of error estimation in their
              experimental design prevents conclusions being made regarding the
              underlying mechanisms of why self-controlled feedback schedules
              optimize learning. Here, we revisited Chiviacowsky and Wulf's
              (2005) design to investigate the learning benefits of
              self-controlled feedback schedules. We replicated their
              Self-Before and Self-After groups, but added a Self-Both group
              that was able to request feedback before a trial, but could then
              change or stay with their original choice after the trial.
              Importantly, yoked groups were included for the three
              self-controlled groups to address the previously stated
              methodological limitation and error estimations were included to
              examine whether self-controlling feedback facilitates a more
              accurate error detection and correction mechanism. The Self-After
              and Self-Before groups demonstrated similar accuracy in physical
              performance and error estimation scores in retention and
              transfer, and both groups were significantly more accurate than
              the Self-Before group and their respective Yoked groups (p's
              0.05). We suggest these findings further indicate that
              informational factors associated with the processing of feedback
              for the development of one's error detection and correction
              mechanism, rather than motivational processes are more critical
              for why self-controlled feedback schedules optimize motor

              received feedback. One group (``self-after'') decided after every
              trial whether they wanted to receive feedback for that trial
              while another group (``self-before'') made that decision before

              delayed transfer test (novel absolute timing requirements) with
              regard to overall timing and relative-timing accuracy. Thus,
              self-controlled feedback was more effective when the learner
              could make a decision about receiving feedback after the trial.
              This seems to support the view that self-controlled feedback

              to hang (Exp. 2) resulted in better retention than did being
              denied these same choices (i.e., yoked condition). The

              incidental choices can result in superior outcomes when compared

              hypothesized that motor learning could be enhanced by providing
              learners with choices - even if those choices are unrelated to
              task performance. In Experiment 1, two groups of participants
              practiced a golf putting task. While one group (the choice group)
              was able to select the color of golf balls (white, yellow, or
              orange) to be used in each upcoming block of 10 trials,
              participants in the second group (the yoked group) were provided
              with the same colored golf balls their choice-group counterparts
              had chosen. The results of a 24-h delayed retention test
              indicated significantly greater putting accuracy for the choice
              compared with the yoked group. Experiment 2 went one step further
              by asking choice group participants for their preferences
              regarding two issues unrelated to the practice task (balancing on
              a stabilometer): (1) which of two subsequent tasks (coincident

              put on the wall. Balance learning was significantly more
              effective in the choice group on a retention test. Thus,

              strategic learning advantages. Self-controlled effects in motor

              focus of attention on the intended movement effect. We propose
              the OPTIMAL (Optimizing Performance through Intrinsic Motivation
              and Attention for Learning) theory of motor learning. We suggest
              that motivational and attentional factors contribute to
              performance and learning by strengthening the coupling of goals
              to actions. We provide explanations for the performance and
              learning advantages of these variables on psychological and
              neuroscientific grounds. We describe a plausible mechanism for
              expectancy effects rooted in responses of dopamine to the
              anticipation of positive experience and temporally associated
              with skill practice. Learner autonomy acts perhaps largely
              through an enhanced expectancy pathway. Furthermore, we consider
              the influence of an external focus for the establishment of
              efficient functional connections across brain networks that
              subserve skilled movement. We speculate that enhanced
              expectancies and an external focus propel performers' cognitive
              and motor systems in productive ``forward'' directions and
              prevent ``backsliding'' into self- and non-task focused states.
              Expected success presumably breeds further success and helps
              consolidate memories. We discuss practical implications and
              future research directions.",

              understanding of the learning advantages underlying a
              self-controlled practice context through the tenets of the
              self-determination theory (SDT). Three micro-theories within the
              macro-theory of SDT (Basic psychological needs theory, Cognitive
              Evaluation Theory, and Organismic Integration Theory) are used as
              a framework for examining the current self-controlled motor
              learning literature. A review of 26 peer-reviewed, empirical
              studies from the motor learning and medical training literature
              revealed an important limitation of the self-controlled research
              in motor learning: that the effects of motivation have been
              assumed rather than quantified. The SDT offers a basis from which
              to include measurements of motivation into explanations of
              changes in behavior. This review suggests that a self-controlled
              practice context can facilitate such factors as feelings of
              autonomy and competence of the learner, thereby supporting the
              psychological needs of the learner, leading to long term changes
              to behavior. Possible tools for the measurement of motivation and
              regulation in future studies are discussed. The SDT not only

               Many manipulations targeting intrinsic motivation have led to
               improved learning, but the mechanisms underlying this effect are
               not known. Replicating a previous study, we manipulated
               intrinsic motivation by giving one group self-control over the
               difficulty of practice, while a control group was yoked to that
               schedule. We collected measures of intrinsic motivation,
               engagement, and physiological measures related to dopamine
               (spontaneous eye-blink rate; sEBR) and approach motivation
               (frontal alpha asymmetry; FAS) to understand mechanisms
               underlying learning effects. Although the effect of self-control

               result was statistically significant when combined with the
               results of our previous study. Overall, there is evidence for a
               benefit of self-control during practice, but the true
               effect-size is smaller than initially estimated. Furthermore,
               even though self-control led to increased intrinsic motivation
               in the current experiment, individual differences in motivation
               were not correlated with learning. Similarly, neither sEBR nor
               FAS were related to learning. Taking a cumulative view, these
               data suggest that self-control of practice is beneficial to both
               learning and motivation, but increased motivation does not
               appear to directly cause improved learning.",

  abstract  = "Researchers have shown that learners who self-control (SC) their
               knowledge of results (KR) schedule learn the task more
               effectively than yoked learners. A common recommendation from
               these results is that learners should be provided choice over
               their KR schedule, rather than at a coaches' discretion (Wulf \&
               Lewthwaite, 2016). No research to date has compared SC learners
               to a group that more closely mimics receiving KR from a coach,
               thus challenging whether such a recommendation can be made. To
               this end, three groups learned a golf putting task; an SC group,
               a traditional yoked group (TY), and a group who were led to
               believe that their KR schedule was being controlled by a golf
               coach (perceived coach-controlled yoked group; PCC).
               Participants (N = 60) completed three phases; pre-test,
               acquisition, and two 24-hr delayed post-tests
               (retention/transfer). All groups lowered their mean radial error
               (MRE) and bivariate variable error (BVE) throughout acquisition.
               As hypothesized, the SC group (M = 40.10) had lower adjusted MRE
               compared to the TY group (M = 43.12) during the post-tests, yet,
               the PCC group had the lowest adjusted MRE (M = 36.61). These
               differences, however, were not statistically significant, F(2,
               54) = 2.81, p = .069. BVE did not display the same pattern as
               MRE during the post-test as group means were clustered together,
               F(2, 57) = 0.38, p = .963. Results from a questionnaire
               indicated that both yoked groups showed moderate ratings for
               receiving KR on a desired schedule, as well as preferring KR on
               good trials, or good and bad trials equally. Taken together,
               these results call into question the recommendation for
               practitioners to give choice to a learner over KR scheduling.",

               the vast majority of empirical results can actually improve
               statistical inference and estimation. Simulations demonstrate
               that, if statistical significance is used as a criterion for

               published findings greatly reduces publication selection bias
